Item: [State]

High priority:									
	Fix volume control [hack removed - no UI / didn't work - have fn+ shortcuts anyway]
	Fix seeking [Works poorly, can definitely be improved]
	Fix API usage to use async ones so that things happen in the background and the UI can be updated as and when, would also allow responding to external events eg unplugging of headphones/set

Medium priority:
	Create icon [done]
	Save last frequency
	3 frequency saving slots at the bottom like in LOS FM Radio (or second page with list of all found frequencies and radio station name from radio text/user renamed)
	Switch between headphones and speakers [done]

Low priority:
	Show a frequency graph of signal quality per frequency (cached and updated at seek time) taps would refresh and seek in both directions from tap to find local maxima
	Add radio text support
	Recording
	Settings (Choose frequency band)
